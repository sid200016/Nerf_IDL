Nerf - Volume Rendering - Introduction to Deep Learning Project
===================================


##  0. Setup

### 0.1 Environment setup
You can use the python environment you've set up for past assignments, or re-install it with our `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate l3d
```

If you do not have Anaconda, you can quickly download it [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), or via the command line in with:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
#Follow the instruction in pdf for more details for creating the conda env

### NeRF rendering
Run the following command:
```bash
python main.py --config-name=nerf_lego
```

This will create a NeRF with the `NeuralRadianceField` class in `implicit.py`, and use it as the `implicit_fn` in `VolumeRenderer`. It will also train a NeRF for 250 epochs on 128x128 images.

After training, a spiral rendering will be written to `images/part_3.gif`.
